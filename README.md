### ADOBE ExtendScript mini toolkit

> here I want to add all the usefull scripts to develop AES extensions to this one tiny plugin to make it easier (a bit) to develope for AES
> please join me in this project if you are interested, I'll really apreciate it :)

> right now there is just Graphic to Text script available in the toolkit (which converts a binary image file into a javascript embedable string file), all the credits for this script (graphic2text) though, goes to **Bob Stucky** and **Peter Kahrel**
